## 0.9.1 - January 3, 2017
- Fixed major memory leak in persistence context management.

## 0.9.0 - December 13, 2016
- Support for single inheritance.

## 0.8.8 - December 9, 2016

on an entity or its mapped superclass and the query will be available in the persistence unit.

## 0.8.3 - July 12, 2016
- Consistent handling of instances with the same identifier (i.e. the same individual). Only single instance with a given
identifier is allowed in one persistence context. But, persisting the same individual as instance of different classes in
different persistence contexts is possible.

## 0.8.2 - July 4, 2016
- Major improvement of instance loading in the Sesame driver
- Fixed bug in `CollectionChangeDetector`, which caused identical collection to behave as different (issue with element ordering)

## 0.7.9 - May 22, 2016
- Fixed issue with running multiple persistence units in the same VM.

## 0.7.8 - May 16, 2016
- Implemented support for `EntityManager.unwrap`. Using unwrap, it is possible to get a hold of for example the Sesame 
    in-memory repository used by the Sesame driver (which is otherwise, due to the Sesame API architecture, inaccessible 
    through the `RepositoryProvider`.

## 0.7.7 - May 11, 2016
- Added the possibility to generate only vocabulary using OWL2Java, without the Java object model itself.

## 0.7.6 - April 15, 2016
- Added support for plain identifiers as values of Annotation and Object properties
    - E.g. when an entity has an object property pointing to another individual, but that individual is not mapped by any class in the object model, its URI can now be used as the property value

## 0.7.5 - March 31, 2016
- Use xsd:int for mapping Java Integer/int values to RDF. Most Java implementations (including JAXB) do it this way.

## 0.7.4 - March 21, 2016
- Implemented support for typed @Properties fields (i.e. @Properties field can now be a `Map<URI, Set<Object>>`, where values have corresponding types instead of plain strings)
